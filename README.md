# Big Sir
## Joining the mac os clone wars.. Here's mine

Built with [React](https://reactjs.org/) and [XState](https://github.com/davidkpiano/xstate)

## Features
- Draggable desktop icons. Click to open corresponding apps
- Context Menu to reset icon positions
- Window management (focus priority, minimize, maximize)
- Terminal
  - Able to open/view files in NeoVim (ex: nvim/home/personal/Resume.js)
    - I disabled the `cat` command, only `nvim` works
  - Basic commands such as `ls|cd|pwd|^C|CMD + K`
  - Command history
- Chrome with browsing history/bookmarks
  - Note: most sites don't allow iframes to load them
- Finder
  - Able to open/view apps in three mode (detail/list/icon)

## Whats next?
- Ability to create html files and view them live on chrome (like codepen)
- Spotify desktop client
- more terminal features (ex: help)
- Anything really..


### I tried to keep only things that were functional on the app. The visual only components at the moment are the command panel top right and the trashcan
